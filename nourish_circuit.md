# Nourish Circuit

The Nourish Circuit applies orthomolecular principles to help players understand how specific foods influence neurotransmitter balance and mood. This loop introduces real-life, in-game recipes that support dopamine, serotonin, and GABA production through amino acids and cofactor-rich ingredients.

## Objectives
- Teach players how food combinations impact neurotransmitter pathways
- Reinforce that everyday meals can support emotional and mental wellness
- Provide simple, repeatable recipes they can use in and out of the game

## Prompts
- Did you eat any mood-supportive meals today, like peanut butter stuffed dates or a warm oat bowl?
- Which recipe helped you feel more focused, calm, or emotionally stable?
- What foods made your body or brain feel more nourished today?

## Affirmation
"I nourish my mind with the building blocks of balance and clarity."
