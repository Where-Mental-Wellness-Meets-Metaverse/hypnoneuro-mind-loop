# HypnoNeuro Mind Loop

**A gamified behavioral engine combining naturopathic neuroscience, orthomolecular medicine, and daily micro-interventions to support emotional healing and mental clarity.**

HypnoNeuro Mind Loop is the therapeutic core of the HypnoNeuro ecosystem. It empowers users to complete behavior-based "loops" that retrain the nervous system, regulate emotions, and apply food-mood strategies through guided, game-integrated actions.

## ðŸŽ® Core Features

- **Loop Modules**: Each loop focuses on a therapeutic theme (e.g., Laundry Loop, Nourish Circuit) and offers prompts, mood-based choices, and real-life applications.
- **Orthomolecular Nutrition**: Game recipes are designed to support neurotransmitter and neuropeptide balance (serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and endorphins) using nutrients like tryptophan, tyrosine, magnesium, and mood-elevating whole foods.
- **Nervous System Repatterning**: Players engage in symbolic micro-actions like folding, sorting, breath pacing, or sensory focus to downshift from emotional overload.
- **Real-Life Carryover**: All in-game activities are modeled after actionable, real-world habits â€” from grounding routines to mood-specific meals and dopamine-endorphin snack pairings.

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- **Players**: Seeking natural, gamified healing tools without pharmaceutical dependency.
- **Practitioners**: Guiding clients using lifestyle medicine, food-mood tracking, and avatar-supported interaction.
- **Educators**: Teaching trauma-informed behavior change, orthomolecular strategies, and digital wellness literacy.
- **Investors & Partners**: Exploring the intersection of mental health, Web3, and decentralized healing technologies.

## ðŸš€ Sample Modules

- `laundry_loop.md` â€” Use symbolic sorting, visualization, and movement to clear mental static and re-center.
- `nourish_circuit.md` â€” Build awareness of how specific foods influence neurotransmitter function and emotional states, with mood-based snack examples.
