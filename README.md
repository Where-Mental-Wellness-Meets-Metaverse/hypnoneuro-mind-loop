# HypnoNeuro Mind Loop

**A gamified behavioral engine combining naturopathic neuroscience, orthomolecular medicine, and daily micro-interventions to support emotional healing and mental clarity.**

ðŸ§  HypnoNeuro Room Structure

- **Level 1: Hypnosis Room** â€“ Core hypnosis protocol and session engagement.
- **Level 2: Mental Wellness Room** â€“ Mind Loop games like Clean Cycle and Nourish that reinforce behavioral healing through holistic tasks.
- **Level 3: Inner Child Healing Room** â€“ A playful, restorative space where users reconnect with their younger selves through safe, imaginative games designed to heal the parts of them that were fragmented by early emotional burdens or forced to grow up too soon.


## ðŸŽ® Core Features

- **Loop Modules**: Each loop focuses on a therapeutic theme (e.g., Laundry Loop, Nourish Circuit) and offers prompts, mood-based choices, and real-life applications.
- **Orthomolecular Nutrition**: Game recipes are designed to support neurotransmitter and neuropeptide balance (serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and endorphins) using nutrients like tryptophan, tyrosine, magnesium, and mood-elevating whole foods.
- **Nervous System Repatterning**: Players engage in symbolic micro-actions like folding, sorting, breath pacing, or sensory focus to downshift from emotional overload.
- **Real-Life Carryover**: All in-game activities are modeled after actionable, real-world habits â€” from grounding routines to mood-specific meals and dopamine-endorphin snack pairings.

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

- **Players**: Seeking natural, gamified healing tools without pharmaceutical dependency.
- **Practitioners**: Guiding clients using lifestyle medicine, food-mood tracking, and avatar-supported interaction.
- **Educators**: Teaching trauma-informed behavior change, orthomolecular strategies, and digital wellness literacy.
- **Investors & Partners**: Exploring the intersection of mental health, Web3, and decentralized healing technologies.

## ðŸš€ Sample Modules

- `laundry_loop.md` â€” Use symbolic sorting, visualization, and movement to clear mental static and re-center.
- `nourish_circuit.md` â€” Build awareness of how specific foods influence neurotransmitter function and emotional states, with mood-based snack examples.
