# ðŸ¥£ Mind Loop: Nourish


The Nourish Circuit applies orthomolecular principles to help players understand how specific foods influence neurotransmitter and neuropeptide balance. This loop introduces real-life, in-game recipes that support dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and endorphin production through amino acid-rich and mood-elevating ingredients.

## Objectives
- Teach players how food combinations impact neurotransmitter and endorphin pathways
- Reinforce that everyday meals can support emotional and mental wellness
- Provide simple, repeatable recipes they can use in and out of the game

## Prompts
- Did you eat any mood-supportive meals today, like peanut butter stuffed dates or a warm oat bowl?
- Which recipe helped you feel more focused, uplifted, or emotionally steady?
- What foods made your body or brain feel more nourished today?

## Affirmation
"I nourish my mind with the building blocks of balance and clarity."
