## 🔍 Problem

People with mental health challenges often struggle with:
- Forgetting to eat or delaying meals
- Feeling overwhelmed by cooking or grocery shopping
- Relying on ultra-processed foods that worsen neurotransmitter function

This leads to blood sugar instability, anxiety spikes, and worsened depressive symptoms. It also prevents users from building self-confidence through food preparation.

## 🧠 Neurochemical Rationale

| Neurochemical | Role                 | Deficiency Effect          |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Dopamine**  | Motivation, pleasure | Apathy, avoidance          |
| **Serotonin** | Mood, satiety        | Irritability, cravings     |
| **GABA**      | Calm, digestion      | Tension, stomach distress  |

Proper nutrition supports neurotransmitter production.  
Mind Loop: Nourish helps users learn how to match food with emotional needs — without overwhelming detail.
