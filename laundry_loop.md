# Laundry Loop

The Laundry Loop reframes everyday tasks as opportunities for nervous system regulation. Rooted in naturopathic psychology, this module helps players reduce emotional overload by engaging in symbolic sorting, breath pacing, and rhythmic flow. It supports emotional reset through presence-based micro-actions.

## Objectives
- Use movement and rhythm to downshift the nervous system
- Reframe daily responsibilities as healing opportunities
- Support mood regulation through breath, flow, and symbolic clearing

## Prompts
- Which part of today’s task helped you feel most present — folding, sorting, or breathing?
- Did the rhythm or repetition help ease your mental state?
- How did your mood shift after completing the loop?

## Affirmation
"I bring ease and regulation into everyday moments."
